## Fake or Real Audio Classification
## Introduction

Fake audio can be used maliciously to spread misinformation. This project leverages Deep Learning techniques (Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)) to create a model capable of detecting fake audio. It provides a robust tool to combat audio-based misinformation by offering a reliable classification system.

This project proposes an automated solution to classify audio as real or fake. It includes the following steps:

Preprocessing raw audio files using Librosa to extract meaningful features.
Training a robust model using TensorFlow.
Deploying a user-friendly interface for real-time testing using Streamlit.

## Features
Preprocessing: Extracts Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and other audio features using Librosa.
Deep Learning Model: Leverages RNN (LSTM) to capture sequential audio patterns.
Interactive Interface: Provides real-time predictions using a web-based UI built with Streamlit.

## Model Workflow
Data Preprocessing:
Audio files are processed into 2-second segments.
Librosa is used to extract features such as:
MFCC
Chroma
Mel Spectrogram
Features are normalized for input to the neural network.

Model Training:
RNN (LSTM) is used for sequential pattern recognition.
TensorFlow is employed to build and train the model.

Model Evaluation:
Evaluates performance on validation and testing datasets using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Deployment:
Streamlit is used to create an interactive interface for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model
Librosa: For audio feature extraction
Streamlit: For creating an interactive web-based interface
